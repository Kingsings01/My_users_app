# Welcome to My Users App
***

## Task
In this project we will creat a web application "User_app" by implementing
a very famous architecture: MVC (Model View Controller).

## Description
The app.rb provides a basic RESTful API for user management, which can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications.


## Installation
To get started with this app, you'll need to have Ruby and Rails installed on your machine. Once you've cloned this repository to your local machine, run the following commands:
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails server
This will install all the necessary dependencies, set up the database, and start the Rails server.

## Usage
To use this app, simply navigate to the localhost from your web browser. From there, you can view a list of all users, as well as add, edit, and delete users as needed.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
